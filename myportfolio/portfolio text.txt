 About Section (Intriguing & Professional)
I'm Lilian Obi — a creative mind with a passion for bringing ideas to life through design and functionality. With a background in sales and team leadership, I transitioned into the world of design and development where I now focus on crafting visually engaging, user-friendly web experiences.

My journey has been one of evolution — from managing sales teams to managing pixels and code. I’ve led people, built processes, and now, I’m building beautiful interfaces and experiences.

I specialize in creating responsive websites and intuitive layouts, with growing experience in front-end tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m currently expanding my skills in React and modern web development frameworks.

I look forward to working with forward-thinking brands and individuals — designing not just for aesthetics, but for impact and usability. Let’s create something extraordinary together.
